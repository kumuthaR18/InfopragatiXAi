# InfoPragatix AI: A Guardian for Every Woman  

## 🔴 The Night That Changed India Forever  

It was a cold December night in 2012. A 23-year-old woman, full of dreams, was on her way home after watching a movie. She had plans, ambitions, and a bright future ahead. But that night, something horrible happened. She was brutally attacked by a group of men, left to die on the streets of Delhi.  

Her name was **Nirbhaya**, which means "fearless". But she was not the only one. Every day, girls and women in India **face harassment, abuse, and violence**, often with no one to help them.  

The country **protested, cried, and demanded justice**. Laws were changed, helplines were created, but **are women truly safe today?**  

Even now:  
- A **10-year-old girl fears walking alone to school.**  
- A **16-year-old hesitates to report bullying and online abuse.**  
- A **young woman in an office endures harassment, afraid of losing her job.**  
- A **wife suffers in silence, believing she has nowhere to go.**
  
**Why? Why should women have to live in fear?**

**What if technology could change this? What if a single app could help every woman in every situation?**
